        <!-- United Kingdom section -->
        <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
        <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
        <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>

        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <p>We loved Italy! From the ancient ruins to the beautiful scenery and delicious food, we still have many wonderful memories.</p>

        <!-- Greece section -->
        <h2>Greece</h2>
        <p>Greece was our first major trip away, and after a cold half-term in England we were happy to get to the much milder climate of Greece!</p>
